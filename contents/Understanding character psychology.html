<li>A writer needs to understand what makes people tick, to know why people do what they do, want what they want. People don’t act without a reason. Every action has motivation and intention.<br></li>
<li>To understand how character psychology might be constructed, let’s look more closely at the two Rain Man characters Charlie Babbitt and Raymond Babbitt. Although Raymond is the character who demanded the most specialized research, understanding Charlie’s psychology was at least as important— since it drove the story.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Inner backstory'>Inner backstory</h2><ul>
<li>Often it is not a particular circumstance that determines a character’s psychological makeup; rather, it’s how she or he reacts to the circumstances.</li>
<li>Understanding that the full-blown adult still has the child of the past inside.</li>
<li>One of the first issues a child confronts is that of trust. An infant needs to feel secure in the world, and this begins with trusting the parents. If this trust is lacking, the child will go through life unable to trust others.</li>
<li>If in early childhood there is not security, love, and trust, children will experience an absence of support, and with it a lack of belief in themselves. This rage will be turned either inward (“I’m no good”) or outward (“I hate you”).</li>
<li>The lack of self-esteem and self-confidence will affect the issue of identity. If children are constantly criticized, their identity is formed by what the parent thinks of them, not by who they really are.
<ul>
<li>In Rain Man, we see both negative and positive events from Charlie’s past. Ron Bass tells of these early influences that changed Charlie’s ability to trust: “When Charlie was two years old he lived in a house where his father was a very busy, successful businessman and paid no attention to him at all.</li>
<li>But that didn’t really register on Charlie because two-year-old Charlie had a loving, caring mother and he had the Rain Man, this brother who was sixteen or eighteen years old, who lived in the house, who never went out, who adored him, and who cuddled him and sang to him.</li>
<li>But suddenly his mother died, which would be an unbelievably traumatic event for any two-year-old child and especially for a two-year-old boy who was not having a warm, loving relationship with his father. Almost immediately thereafter the only other source of love and comfort he has in the family is sent away and it’s a very tearful departure, ‘Bye-bye, Rain Man, bye-bye, Rain Man.’ So we set up a kid who has all of his emotional supports knocked out from under him at the age of two.</li>
<li>The father had one son who was imperfect, who was autistic, so the second son had to be perfect and fill his life—and his second son wasn’t perfect. True, he was terrific—he got good grades, he was handsome, but that wasn’t good enough. Nothing he could do was ever good enough because Charlie’s father felt that the world had owed him some kind of perfection.</li>
<li>“I don’t think that Charlie was a rebel at all when he was younger. Because he so instinctively felt the need for his fathers love and affection, the less love the father gave him, the more Charlie craved it. So I think that Charlie spent his childhood busting his butt to be perfect for his father. And nothing was ever good enough.” When Charlie was sixteen, he had one moment of rebellion—to test whether his father would still love him, even if he were “bad. “ (Charlie took the car, after getting good grades)</li>
<li>So we’re on Lakeshore Drive. Four kids. Four six-packs. And we get pulled over. He’d called in a report of a stolen car. Not his son took the car without permission. Just . . . stolen. Cook County Jail. Other guys’ dads bail ‘em out in an hour. He left me there. Two . . . days.</li>
<li>With this incident, Charlie learned the truth—that his father didn’t love him. Ron explains, “And so he defies his father and deliberately makes a very clean break in his life. This is a central moment in his life—at sixteen when he walks away out of his father’s life forever.</li>
<li>“So what do you say to yourself when you’re bright and you want the finer things of life? Your father is successful, and a millionaire, and you’ve spent sixteen years chasing that, and so it’s not like you’ve always wanted to rebel against that. All along you’ve always wanted to achieve that and make your dad proud of you. So what do you say when you walk away from that? You can’t say that you’re deliberately destroying yourself to hurt your father—people don’t realize that at that level—instead you say, My father’s a fool, and what I thought I wanted all my life was shallow and materialistic and false and who needs to take that robotic path to success? I’m better than my father ever was and I’ll do it fast and easy and cheap. I’ll go out with only myself to rely on—I can do it!’</li>
</ul>
<br></li>
<li>If these issues had not been resolved with Charlie, he would have reached another crisis—the crisis Erik Erikson calls “generativity versus stagnation.”</li>
<li>This occurs when a person has not lived up to his or her talents. Sometimes this becomes the midlife crisis, where people have to confront where they’ve come in their lives, and what they’ve accomplished.</li>
<li>When someone reaches forty and fifty and beyond, there is another crisis, one of “integrity versus despair.” This crisis is not just one of accomplishments and professional contributions, but of meaning and value. At this point, people confront whether their lives mean anything, whether they’ve had depth. The consequences of not resolving these issues can lead to despair, alcoholism, depression, even suicide.</li>
<li>EXERCISE: Imagine creating a story about a future Charlie Babbitt. What might he be like if you set the story at his midlife crisis, when Charlie is about forty and still failing because he unconsciously felt his father was correct about his inability to succeed? What might Charlie do to compensate?</li>
<li>What would Charlie be like if he were sixty, trying to find meaning in life while still being controlled by his father? How might he express his despair?</li>
<li>What might he be like at these stages if he had resolved his mid-life crisis?What would you expect his relationship with his brother to be like, if the film continued into the future?</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Unconscious'>Unconscious</h2><ul>
<li>People usually have little knowledge of how these unconscious forces influence their behavior. Often these are negative elements that are denied or rationalized.</li>
<li>Within the shadow side of the unconscious can be found rage, sexuality, depression—or, to define it in another way, the seven deadly sins of anger, gluttony, sloth, pride, envy, avarice, and lust.</li>
<li>These unconscious forces achieve more power when they are repressed or denied. Unacknowledged, they can drive people to do and say things against their will. Suppressed, they have more potential to get people into trouble.
<ul>
<li>Charlie has no recognition that his actions and behavior are driven, to a great extent, by his need for his father’s love and approval. According to Ron Bass, “Charlie’s need is to be self-contained, to keep himself walled off from feeling the hurt of rejection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The unconscious manifests itself in your characters through their behavior, gestures, and speech. All these underlying drives and meanings that are unknown to the characters will nevertheless affect what they say and do.</li>

<li>During the last hundred years, there has been much reinterpretation of these personality types, and, as a writer, being familiar with the theories can be helpful in differentiating your characters, and strengthening character conflicts.</li>
<li>Sensation people experience life through the senses. They are attuned to their physical environment—to colors and smells, shapes and tastes. They tend to live in the present, responding to the things around them. Many sensation types make good cooks, house builders, doctors, photographers— any occupation that is physical and sensory-oriented. James Bond would probably be considered a sensation type— sensual, a lover of fast cars, physical activities, and beautiful women.</li>
<li>Thinking types are the opposite. They think through a situation, figure out the problem, and take control to bring about a solution. They make decisions based on principles, not on feelings. They’re logical, objective, methodical. Thinking types tend to make good administrators, engineers, mechanics, executives. Characters who have strong thinking functions include Perry Mason, Jessica Fletcher, MacGyver, and the Marquise in Dangerous Liaisons.</li>
<li>Feeling types have a sense of rapport with others. They care, are sympathetic and warmhearted. Their feelings are often accessible and up front. Teachers, social workers, and nurses are often feeling types. In films and novels, they would include Madame de Torville in Dangerous Liaisons, Pfc. Eriksson in Casualties of War, Tess McGill in Working Girl.</li>
<li>Intuitive are interested in future possibilities. They’re the dreamers, with new visions, plans, ideas. They play hunches, have premonitions, and live in anticipation of what will come to pass in the future. Intuitive are often entrepreneurs, inventors, and artists whose ideas sometimes come to them “full-blown.” Some bank robbers and gamblers are intuitive, looking to future enjoyment of their wealth. Obi-Wan-Kenobi from Star Wars is an intuitive who recognizes the nature of the invisible Force. Sam in “Cheers” is also an intuitive—he always has a hunch that he’s going to get any woman he wants. Even Gordon Gekko in Wall Street seems to have a strong intuitive function as he plans and schemes.</li>
<li>These functions never exist alone. Most people have two dominant functions and two inferior functions (sometimes called the “shadow functions “).
<ul>
<li>Gain their information about the world around them either through sensation (direct experience) or through intuition.</li>
<li>Process information either through thinking or through feeling.</li>
</ul>

<li>In order to create the character of Raymond Babbitt, Barry Morrow needed to know the characteristics of the autistic, the autistic savant, and the mentally retarded.</li>
<li>Barry relates how he became interested in the autistic savant: “I had volunteered some time every year to the Association for Retarded Citizens. One afternoon we were having a break and I felt a tap on my shoulder and there—one-half inch from my nose—was the nose of Rain Man. Kim is his name. And he cocked his head with a sort of quizzical look on his face and said to me, ‘Think about it, Barry Morrow.’ And I took a good yard step back and cocked my head and thought about what he had said; and he looked sort of like a Zen master in his own peculiar way, and, mercifully, just then his father showed up to make sense of it all. He introduced me to Kim and he said that Kim was so excited to meet me that that’s why he got his words mixed up. What he meant to say was ‘I think about you, Barry Morrow.’ And he turned his head the other way and started making this groaning sound and started flapping his hands real fast, and then he started to say some names.</li>
<li>“I didn’t know what was going on, but then I recognized one name that seemed familiar, and then another, and I realized that what he was doing was reciting the names from the credits from my movies, Bill and Bill on His Own—in order. Then he started again with numbers, but they were going by so fast they made no sense. And his father asked Kim to slow down and told him that I didn’t understand. He slowed down and I realized he was giving my phone numbers of the last eight or ten years over and over again. His father said he memorizes phone books for a hobby— thousands. He generally only memorizes the Yellow Pages but in my case he made an exception. Anything he reads he commits to memory.</li>
<li>The more questions I asked, the more astounded I was by the answers, and there seemed to be no end to the amazing aspects of this person. I flew home and my head was just spinning with him. I just knew I had met one of the world’s extraordinary creatures and how privileged I was.”<br></li>
<li>Understanding abnormal behavior is essential when writing these kinds of characters. But having some knowledge about abnormal behavior can also be helpful when writing about normal characters. All of us have some of these elements within us. Giving your normal characters some of these characteristics can add conflict and interest.<br></li>
<li>Manic types think they can do anything. They appear very optimistic, exhibiting a kind of emotional euphoria. Highly excitable and often very social, manics are easily given to emotional outbursts. They can be frivolous and overtalkative. Their attention span is short and their threshold for boredom extremely low. Furthermore, as they pursue what they want, they tend to trample on others with little thought.
<ul>
<li>Characters who are normal, but have some manic qualities, may be workaholics, driven by the need to succeed. They may be driven by greed, as is Gordon Gekko in Wall Street, or by a belief that everything will work out and they can build a whole new world, as is Allie in The Mosquito Coast, or by a conviction that they can do anything, as are the villains in Superman.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depressives are the other side of the coin. They tend to conserve their emotional energy. They are subject to black moods, feelings of worthlessness and inferiority. Some tend to be hypochondriacs, or to blame themselves even when they are not at fault.
<ul>
<li>Characters who might be considered normal, but contain a number of these qualities are: Hamlet, Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon, and David from the play Strange Snow (later made into the film Jackknife).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Schizophrenic characters have appeared in a number of successful films. I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, David and Lisa, and the television movie Promise all come to mind. Schizophrenics tend to be shy, self-conscious, overly sensitive, and easily embarrassed. They protect their ego by avoiding open conflict. They withdraw, sulk, and generally have a difficult time communicating.
<ul>
<li>Arthur “Boo” Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird might be considered borderline schizophrenic, and Macon in The Accidental Tourist could be considered a normal personality with some schizophrenic characteristics, brought on by his grief over the death of his son.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paranoids believe people are out to get them. As a result, they tend to be aggressive. They want to be leaders, to have power and prestige over others. They are decisive, stubborn, opinionated, defensive, often competitive, arrogant, conceited, and boastful. They often harbor unreasonable grudges, are quick to take offense, and are very sensitive to any personal criticism, which supports their belief that others don’t like them. Many of the Charles Bronson and Sylvester Stallone film characters show some of these qualities.</li>
<li>Anxiety neurotics worry about and fear everything. They are concerned about personal safety, terror-stricken about the greenhouse effect, the ozone layer, acid rain, rape, and the general realities of life. For them, disaster lurks everywhere. They spend their lives trying to avoid anxiety.
<ul>
<li>The favorite anxiety neurotic for many moviegoers is Woody Allen, in such films as Hannah and Her Sisters, Annie Hall, and Zelig.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The obsessive/compulsive character also is a neurotic. Alex’s obsession with the unwilling Dan in Fatal Attraction and the compulsion of Raymond Babbitt, who has to watch “People’s Court” every day, are both examples of obsessive behavior that drives the character.<br></li>
<li>These characters do not transform. If you decide to have characters who are psychopaths or sociopaths, remember that they cannot become normal, well-adjusted individuals by the end of the film.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id='Application'>Application</h2><ul>
<li>What traumatic incidents in my character’s past might affect present behavior? Are there good influences in the past that might influence transformation in the present?</li>
<li>What unconscious forces are driving my character? How do they affect my character’s motivations, actions, and goals?</li>
<li>What character types have I drawn upon for my major and supporting characters? Am I getting contrast and conflict from these character relationships?</li>
<li>Have I made my characters too nice, too bland, too normal? Is there anything a little abnormal about them? How do their abnormalities cause conflict with other characters?</li>
