<h2 id='Rogue’s Main Quest'>Rogue’s Main Quest</h2><ul>
<li>Creating a small expansion set (as might be offered in a promotional pack) for an existing, commercially released game.</li>
<li>Analyzing what has already been released for the game and deriving a mathematical model to describe the relationship between the costs and benefits of the various game objects (in other words, how the costs of everything in the game are determined, based on how powerful they are and what they do for you).</li>
<li>Create an original mechanic of your own design that does not yet exist in the game, tentatively come up for what it costs based on the analysis you did and your intuition, and then create a small number (five to ten) of new game objects that showcase your new mechanic.</li>
</ul><br>
<hr><br>
<ul>
<li>Start now by choosing a game with relatively simple systems in one of the following genres:
<ul>
<li>TCG, LCG (Living Card Game), deck building game, miniatures game, or a tabletop RPG (role-playing game) that has combat resolution rules.</li>
<li>If you prefer video games, choose a TBS (turn-based strategy) or RTS (real-time strategy) computer game that has mod tools, such that you can modify the numbers and capabilities of various units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify game objects that are clearly overpowered, others that are clearly underpowered, and others that feel “just right” as ideal paragons of balance. You will be using these later to construct and test your own mathematical models, to make sure that your math identifies the most broken objects as such.
<ul>
<li>If you are very familiar with the game, you may do this using just your own experience and intuition. Otherwise, you may wish to supplement by looking online for strategy articles, player or developer forums, or similar sources to see what the player community has identified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='After leaning Curves'>After leaning Curves</h3><ul>
<li>List all of the resources in the game state that you can think of.
<ul>
<li>In a card game, this might involve the resources used to put cards into play (mana, gold, etc.), cards in hand (or in a draw deck or in a discard pile), life points or victory points.</li>
<li>In a turn-based or real-time strategy game, this might include resource units (gold, oil, or whatever is used to bring more units into play), military or other units in play, structures and upgrades, advancement along a tech tree, and so on.</li>
<li>For a tabletop miniatures game, these are usually not resource-heavy you’d be thinking of your units, individual units’ health, and combat stats (defense to improve survivability, attack to remove opponents’ units from play).</li>
<li>In a tabletop RPG, you might consider currency, experience points/levels, player stats, and health/hit points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify the relationships between resources.
<ul>
<li>Can some resources be converted to others, either by the core mechanics of the game or by the special rules of a specific game object?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Express the resource flow of the game through a diagram. You might use a diagramming language like <b>Machinations</b> or just a manual diagram of boxes and arrows drawn by hand or in a computer program.</li>

<h3 id='After learning Cost Curves'>After learning Cost Curves</h3><ul>
<li>Identify some subset of the game’s mechanics and game objects that are meaningful within a relatively self-contained system.
<ul>
<li>For a CCG or similar card game, this might be a particular class of cards</li>
<li>In a turn-based or real-time strategy game or tabletop miniatures game, consider the combat units of the game</li>
<li>Tabletop RPG, you might look at item and equipment lists, or a list of spells or feats or other capabilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There should be enough material to be able to find similarities and patterns, but not so much material to sort through that it becomes unwield.
<ul>
<li>About 30-60 items after remove unique items that can’t be compared with anything else</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derive the cost curve and supporting math for these objects, as best you can. List any assumptions you are making.</li>
<li>When running into situations where several objects seem to conflict (one is clearly better than another so that they’re not balanced along the same curve), use your own knowledge of the game, or else strategy articles online, to form a guess for which of the objects is above or below the curve.</li>
<li>In addition to the cost curve and supporting math, create a spreadsheet with formulas to calculate the balance, to show how far above or below the curve any given card is.</li>
<li>Apply a common-sense test. Identify the objects that you analyzed that are the most above or below the curve, given your work so far.
<ul>
<li>Do the things at the extreme ends of your list make sense?</li>
<li>Are your top five objects all things that are currently dominating the meta-game?</li>
<li>Are your bottom five objects all things that get used seldom if at all in competitive play?</li>
<li>For the objects you previously thought of as being perfectly balanced—those that should be exactly on the curve—are they at least close?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the answer to any of those questions is “no,” then go back and look at your math.
<ul>
<li>Why are certain objects being incorrectly classified by your math? Once you identify a problem, fix it in your formulas, then go back and repeat the process, until your set of objects seems like it’s a reasonable representation of reality.</li>
</ul>

</ul><br>
<h3 id='After learning Combat'>After learning Combat</h3><ul>
<li>As you examine the spreadsheet for the cost curve and supporting math</li>
</ul><br>
<p>that you developed in the previous part of this quest line, each column in the sheet that isn’t just a core stat (such as resource cost, or health) can be thought of as a mechanic.</p><ul>
<li>For TCGs or similar card games, those might be common abilities or keywords.</li>
<li>For a turn-based or real-time PC strategy game, it might be a general capability or class of unit.</li>
<li>For tabletop miniatures games, you might see some common unit special abilities.</li>
<li>For tabletop RPGs, you might have some general types of abilities, feats, or similar.</li>
<li>Create one new mechanic along these same lines, essentially adding one more column to your spreadsheet that’s blank or zero for all of your existing rows. Based on your current knowledge of the game, tentatively add the supporting math for your new mechanic to the spreadsheet. Describe the mechanic clearly in the sheet (such as in a cell comment), along with your justification for why you costed it the way you did.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='After learning Progression in PvP'>After learning Progression in PvP</h3><ul>
<li>Take the new mechanic you defined and costed in your cost curve and</li>
</ul><br>
<p>supporting math in Part 5, and create a handful of new game objects to showcase your mechanic.</p><ul>
<li>This doesn’t mean every new object has to have the mechanic; some of them might just interact with it in interesting ways,
<ul>
<li>Working well in combination or providing a soft counter (works well against, while still being useful in its own right) to the mechanic.</li>
<li>In a collectible card game (CCG), this might mean five to ten new cards that each use or interact with your mechanic.</li>
<li>In a turn-based or real-time strategy game, create five to ten new units (spread across multiple factions if the game has such a thing).</li>
<li>In a tabletop miniatures game, create new units for a single faction, or an entire new mini-faction (or offshoot of an existing one).</li>
<li>In a tabletop RPG, create a set of new abilities or feats /or/a new character class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, balance all of your new creations along your existing cost curve and supporting math, so that your math (at least) claims that everything is exactly on the curve (or as close as reasonably possible).</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='After learning Analytics'>After learning Analytics</h3><ul>
<li>Develop an analytics plan (Side-quest 13.1)
<ul>
<li>For your game, in preparation for playtesting. Since you will likely be testing with a small group or on your own, you won’t have enough data for statistical significance, so focus on identifying key questions to ask and what the answers are expected to look like, so that you can be aware of them during playtesting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, carry out your playtest.
<ul>
<li>When you find problems in your playtest, make a note of them, and modify your game objects (and/or fix your cost curve and supporting math) as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, repeat the playtest, fix more problems, and keep doing that as many times as you’re able to in the time you have. Your goal should be to get your new mini-expansion as close to perfectly balanced in this way as you can get it.</li>

</ul><br>
<hr><br>
<ul>
<li>Choose an appropriate game. This should be a video game with some kind of campaign or story that has a clearly defined start and end point.</li>
<li>Make a rough outline of the main story-line or narrative, divided into levels or sections that the player must traverse in order</li>
<li>Then, for each section, mark it as one of the following:
<ol start='1' style='--data-list-start: 1;'>
<li><b>Slow grind</b>. Section is very difficult when first encountered, has multiple roadblocks, is overly large compared to other levels, or otherwise requires the player to do a lot to pass through. Feels frustratingly, artificially slow.</li>
<li><b>Slight grind</b>. Feels a little slower than normal, but not enough to stand out as one of the most frustrating parts of the game.</li>
<li><b>Average</b>. Difficulty is consistent with most of the game, or with what you think of as ideal.</li>
<li><b>Slightly easy</b>. Feels a little more rapid than normal, but not enough to stand out as something the player blasts through instantly.</li>
<li><b>Fast and easy</b>. By the time the player reaches here, they are over-leveled, have built up an excess of skill, or are otherwise so prepared that it provides little challenge. The player then proceeds to pass through the section extremely quickly, facing little or no resistance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Also mark each section that contains one of the most memorable points of the game, such as an important plot point or reversal in the story, or a particularly fun or interesting boss fight or puzzle.</li>
<li>Record all of this in a spreadsheet program, with the first column contain- ing the name of each section, the second column a number from 1 to 5 (as</li>
</ul><br>
<p>above), and the third column an ‘x’ if that section contains one of the high points of the game.</p><br>
<h3 id='After learning about Systems and resources'>After learning about Systems and resources</h3><ul>
<li>Analyze all ways that the player grows stronger in this game

</ul>
</li>
<li>Identify any parts of the game that have either particularly large numbers of rewards or a small number of very strong rewards
<ul>
<li>Such as a weapon found in a certain place that is far more powerful than anything before it, leading to a big jump in power).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also identify parts of the game that have relatively few noteworthy rewards.</li>

<p>For rewards that are random in nature,</p><ul>
<li>Such as loot drops on wandering monsters that have a 0.1% chance of dropping a powerful artifact.</li>
<li>Create a model in a spreadsheet using RAND() or RANDBETWEEN() or similar pseudorandom number generators to give an example of what these rewards might look like on one or more play-throughs.</li>
<li>With reward schedule in hand, look back at your guesses from Part 2. Is there any correlation between the number/strength of player growth in a section with your label of how easy or grind-y it was?</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='After learning about Character Builds'>After learning about Character Builds</h3><ul>
<li>Do a design analysis of the combat system (or closest reasonable equivalent). How would you model a typical combat, such as a random encounter, mathematically?</li>
<li>Choose any specific combat at any point in the game, with player characters that are at an appropriate power level for the situation they’re in.</li>
<li>Determine all of the player characters’ combat stats and inventory, which you can make up so long as it is reasonable for that point in the game that you’ve chosen.</li>
<li>Look up the monsters’ combat stats, as well as all relevant formulas to determine whether an opponent is hit, how much damage attacks do, and so on. The exact formulas are usually not given in the game’s tutorials or manual (though there are occasional exceptions), so you may have to find this in an online FAQ walkthrough, wiki or a published strategy guide. Online MMOs such as <b>World of Warcraft</b> tend to have well-documented stats published online by the community.</li>
<li>Create a spreadsheet that uses the game’s formulas and the stats you’ve compiled in order to simulate the outcome of a combat. In particular, look at several situations:
<ul>
<li>What is the worst-case scenario? If all random rolls go against the player, are they going to die, or are they merely going to lose a few more hit points than they would otherwise? How likely is this to happen?</li>
<li>What is the best-case scenario? Does the player’s adventuring party walk away unharmed, or are they just taking slightly less damage than they would normally? How likely is this, compared with the worst-case outcome?</li>
<li>What is the average or expected outcome? You might compute this using probability calculations, or a Monte Carlo simulation… or ideally, both, to confirm that they are the same (and if you get two different answers, then re-check your calculations to find the problem).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State the implications of your findings. How many combats like this would a party be expected to survive before they’re wiped out (and how does this compare with the number of combats between towns or other places where the party can fully heal)? Based on the rewards for winning the fight,
<ul>
<li>How many of these fights does a player have to beat before the characters level up significantly, and/or before they find enough gold to purchase better equipment?</li>
<li>How much of a threat is losing entirely (and having to restart the game)</li>
<li>How much of that depends on a player’s choices vs. being determined by good or bad die-roll results?</li>
</ul>

<li>Are there any areas that have either a surplus or dearth of rewards, across all types?</li>
<li>Are any of those areas particularly memorable (in a good or bad way) in a way that can be traced back to these rewards?</li>

<h2 id='Wizard’s Main Quest'>Wizard’s Main Quest</h2><ul>
<li>The Wizard’s Main Quest involves starting with an existing core concept for a simple trading card game called Harmony and balancing the game, one step at a time. Normally, trading card games are not a good project to create from scratch for practice</li>
<li>To get started, simply make a playable prototype of the game. You can either copy and cut out the cards on the following four pages or create them manually on 200 index cards</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='After learning about Anchor'>After learning about Anchor</h3><ul>
<li>Find a partner or get prepared to play against yourself.</li>
<li>Start the game, each player shuffles their deck and then draws ten cards into their hand.</li>
<li>A player is randomly chosen to take the first turn.</li>
<li>A player immediately loses the game if their hand or their draw deck is ever empty; the object of the game is to force the opponent to empty one or the other before they do the same to you.</li>
<li>Two types of cards in Harmony: Power cards and Action cards.
<ul>
<li>Power cards provide one of four types of power: Bio, Gear, Magic, or Science. Action cards all have some Power requirements; you must have at least that many Power in play in order to use that Action card.</li>
<li>An Action card might require specific types of Power or “generic” Power that can be any type, or some combination of the two.
<ul>
<li>A card might require 2 Bio+2 Generic, which could be satisfied by having 4 Bio in play, or 2 Bio and 2 Magic, or any other combination of at least four Power where at least two are Bio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A player’s turn is divided into three steps: Draw, Power, and Action. If they have not yet won the game, it then becomes the opponent’s turn, and this continues until one player loses. The steps are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>Draw phase</b>: the player draws two cards from their deck.</li>
<li><b>Power phase</b>: either the player can play one Power card from their hand into play, or if they can’t or choose not to, then they must discard one card from their hand to their discard pile.</li>
<li><b>Action phase</b>: the player can either play one Action card for which they meet the Power requirement of all of their own Power cards in play, or else they must discard one card from their hand to their discard pile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Action cards can perform some combination of the game’s four core mechanics:
<ul>
<li><b>Damage</b>: for each point of damage done to the opponent, take the top card of their draw pile and move it to their discard pile.</li>
<li><b>Healing</b>: for each point of healing, take the top card of your discard pile and put it on the bottom of your draw pile. If there are fewer cards in your discard pile than the amount of healing, move all that you can and ignore the rest (for example, if your discard pile has seven cards and you Heal 9, move all seven cards to the bottom of your deck and the remaining 2 are ignored).</li>
<li><b>Draw</b>: for each point of draw, take the top card of your draw pile and put it in your hand.</li>
<li><b>Discard</b>: for each point of discard, the opponent must choose and discard one card in their hand to their discard pile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, a card that says “Damage 5, Draw 4” means you draw four cards from your own deck, and the opponent takes the top five cards from their deck and put them in their discard pile.</li>
<li>Play each deck against the others (this is at least six games total: Deck A vs. B, A vs. C, A vs. D, B vs. C, B vs. D, and C vs. D).</li>
<li>By then, you should be comfortable with the rules and core mechanics and have a general sense of how powerful Damage, Healing, Draw, and Discard are relative to one another.</li>
<li>As it is, you’ll find the game to be heavily unbalanced. Each of the four mechanics is costed similarly, even though they have drastically different value in play, as you’ll see when you play. For now, just make a mental note of which of the decks and which of the mechanics seems the most and least powerful. You may want to take some written notes to this effect as well, so you can refer back to them in later parts.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='After learning Cost Curves'>After learning Cost Curves</h3><ul>
<li>From playing Harmony, you should have a general sense of which of the</li>
</ul><br>
<p>four mechanics (Heal, Damage, Draw, and Discard) is most or least powerful, and whether there is a law of increasing or diminishing returns with each</p><ul>
<li>Is “Discard 3” three times as good as “Discard 1”… or more or less than that?</li>
<li>You should also have an idea of what the cost curve looks like:</li>
<li>Does something that costs 4 Power give twice as powerful an effect as something that costs 2 Power?</li>
<li>Does increasing Power requirement scale linearly with the benefit, or is it a polynomial or triangular increase, a logarithmic increase, or some other type of curve (or a custom curve that behaves differently at various points and doesn’t fit a single equation)?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between Power of specific types (Bio, Gear, Magic, or Science) and Generic Power— how many Generic are worth one specific?</li>
<li>Make an attempt to develop a cost curve and supporting math for these four mechanics, based on your sense of their general power levels.</li>
<li>Create a spreadsheet with columns for each of the four specific Power types and a fifth for Generic Power, and then four columns for Heal, Damage, Draw, and Discard. Finally, add a column that adds the benefits and subtracts the costs using some formula that you develop on your own, such that 0 is on the curve, negative is below the curve, and positive is above the curve.</li>
<li>Adjust the costs only to get each card to be as close to the curve as possible. Do not change type of Power, only quantity</li>
<li>Your spreadsheet will look something like this, but with a formula in the rightmost column, and the costs modified appropriately:</li>

<h3 id='After learning Progression in PvP'>After learning Progression in PvP</h3><ul>
<li>Here, you have a choice of two paths: balance the starter decks against</li>
</ul><br>
<p>each other, or balance the cards in a constructed-deck environment.</p><br>
<ul>
<li><b>If balancing the starter decks</b>: consider the four supplied starter decks (A, B, C, and D) as four single units. Your goal is to make the decks as balanced as possible against each other. That is, assuming equal player skill, either player should be able to play any two decks against one another and each player/deck should have as close to a 50% chance of winning as possible. If balancing the starters, you can only make the following modifications to the starter decks, and no other changes:</li>
<li>Modify the cost of an Action card (keeping the same Power types in the cost and only modifying how much Power is required to play it, as you did in Part 3).
<ul>
<li>Note that most cards appear in several decks, so modify- ing the cost of a card in one deck means you have to change the cost of that card in all other decks that it appears in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify the number of each type of Power card in the deck. Each deck has two Power types, so you can swap one for the other directly, or you can add extra Power cards of either type by removing an equal number of Action cards, or you can remove Power cards and add extra copies of any Action card that is already in the game (whether it was formerly part of that deck or not).
<ul>
<li>Note that this means you cannot change the effects of any Action cards, create new Action cards with your own effects, or change the total number of cards in a deck (all decks must remain the same size).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Hint</b>: Note that you are balancing decks, not individual cards. While you can certainly attempt to make every individual card balanced against every other card, you can also have some cards that are clearly above the curve, if the rest of the deck is weaker than average otherwise, for example.<br></li>
<li><b>If balancing the cards</b>: assume a constructed-deck environment, where players can make their own decks using whatever cards they want from the list of cards supplied in the four starters (assume all decks must be exactly 50 cards, with a maximum of three copies of any Action card, but otherwise no restrictions). In such a format, each individual card must be balanced against the other cards on the same cost curve.</li>
<li>Make an attempt to balance the cards against one another, using the spreadsheets and any other tools you have developed for this game so far. As before, you can modify the power costs of Action cards but cannot alter the power type(s), nor the effects of playing the cards, nor the core rules of the game.</li>
<li>You do not have to playtest your attempt yet—that is coming in the next part—but just make a good-faith first-run attempt on paper for now, updating your prototype accordingly.</li>

If you’re missing information (such as knowing exactly how much luck plays a role in the outcome), express that information as a variable in your rating formula, take an initial guess for what you think that variable might be, and mention how you might use analytics (see Chapter 13) to discover the value of that variable.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3 id='After learning about Production and Playtesting'>After learning about Production and Playtesting</h3><ul>
<li>Take the cards you modified back in Part 4, and find at least one other</li>
</ul><br>

<li>If you chose to balance the four starter decks, supply these decks to your tester(s).</li>
<li>If you chose to balance the individual cards, provide the cards, along with instructions to your tester(s) that they can build their own custom deck of exactly 50 cards, with no more than three copies of any individual Action card.</li>
<li>In either case, the goal of each player (including you) should be to break the game.</li>
<li>If balancing the starters, players should try to find one starter that they think is stronger or weaker than the others</li>
<li>If balancing the cards in a constructed-deck environment, everyone should try to build a deck that is so powerful that it dominates the play format</li>
<li>If you find individual cards, card combinations, or decks in general that are too powerful through playtesting, make changes by hand to their costs as appropriate.</li>
<li>You may also want to revisit your cost curve and supporting math to try to figure out where something went wrong; if you do, you may find other cards that should be changed that you might not have considered.</li>
